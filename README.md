# Manufacturing Wiki
A collection of information related to both additive and subtractive manufacturing (I.e. 3D Printing and CNC Machining)

Getting started with these areas can be a daunting task and most information is scattered all over the place.
The goal of this repository is to make it easier to get started and to be used as a general reference work for those with more experience.
